## Assumptions and Design Decisions

1. **API Integration**
   - Used JSONPlaceholder API for demonstration purposes
   - Implemented mock POST/PUT/DELETE operations (JSONPlaceholder doesn't actually modify data)
   - Added loading states and error handling for API operations

2. **UI/UX Decisions**
   - Implemented pagination with 10 items per page for better performance
   - Added search functionality across both title and body fields
   - Used modals for create and edit operations
   - Included form validation for required fields
   - Added toast notifications for operation feedback

3. **State Management**
   - Used React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks for state management
   - Implemented useRef to prevent duplicate API calls

## Challenges Faced

1. **API Limitations**
   - JSONPlaceholder is a read-only API, so mutations are simulated
   - Implemented optimistic updates for better user experience
   - Edit will not work for newlyy added data 

2. **Form Validation**
   - Created custom validation logic for form inputs
   - Implemented error handling and display

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensured the table layout works well on different screen sizes
   - Implemented horizontal scrolling for table on mobile devices
